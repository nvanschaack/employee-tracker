## Description
Employee tracker is a terminal application that uses a database to keep track of employees, departments and job roles in a business. Not only can the user view all of the departments, employees, and roles, but they can add a department, new employee, or new role within their company. All data is displayed in a table format in the terminal for easy viewing.

## Installation
Once the user has opened the terminal where the index.js file is located, the user will want to run "npm i" to install all of the dependencies in the package.json file. Then the user will enter the command "node index" to initiate the application and begin the prompt series.

## Usage
Once the user runs "node index" in the terminal, they will be prompted with the question, "What would you like to view?". This is where the user will use the up and down arrow keys to select the action they want to perform; "View all departments", "View all roles", "View all employees", "Add a department", "Add a role", "Add an employee", or "Update an employee role". Once they're hovered over the action they'd like to perform, they will want to hit the enter key to view or add content.
